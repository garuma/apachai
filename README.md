# Apachaï
## Picture uploading for the rest of us

Apachaï is designed to be a small and lightweight photo and picture sharing application (for services like Twitter) built on the [Manos framework](https://github.com/jacksonh/manos). A running instance is available at [apch.fr](http://apch.fr/).

## Dependencies

It depends on a [Redis](http://redis.io/) server available and on [ServiceStack .NET binding](http://code.google.com/p/servicestack/wiki/ServiceStackRedis) to it (included).

Apachaï also leverages code from [TweetStation](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/TweetStation) and [Pinta](https://github.com/jpobst/Pinta).
